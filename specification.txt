/*
- Implement a server-side Resource:
- capable of storing and retrieving xml records of the following form:
<person>
<id>1</id>
<fname>Joe</fname>
<lname>Brown</lname>
<DOB>1987-03-04</DOB>  <!-- date of birth -->
<wage>100</wage>
<location>US</local>  <!-- one of three values: (US = United States, UK = United Kingdom, AU = Australia) -->
</person>
- implemented as a RESTful resource accessed through PUT/POST/GET is preferred, otherwise an equivalent server-side program is okay.
- Any language is acceptable, but sever-side JS preferred.
 
 - Create a webpage primarily using JavaScript that:
- Features a hand coded JS object that:
- implements the basic logic for interacting with the xml resource - load/save/create new/etc  (it's okay to use an AJAX library for the actual data exchange)
- synchs member attributes with the fields of the resource
- has methods to translate the DOB (date of birth) and wage into formats appropriate for the location; using Functional Programming (not using IF/switch statements)
- Uses prototypes and closures to rebuild the object when the location changes, modifying/replacing methods. 
 
- Uses an open source JS library to generate the user interface.
 
- Provides a user interface that:
- has basic widgets for the fields in the XML record
- uses a drop down for location
- has readonly fields that display the translated DOB and Wage values based on location
- rebuilds the JS object and repaints the screen when fields are modified
- has Save and Load buttons
- has a button that displays a JSON representation of the JS object
